## üÜò Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start

```bash
# Check environment variables
cat .env

# Check Node version
node --version  # Should be 20.x

# Check port availability
netstat -an | grep 5000  # Windows
lsof -i :5000           # Mac/Linux

# Check logs
cat logs/combined.log
```

#### Database Connection Failed

```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Test connection with Drizzle Studio
npm run db:studio

# Check if migrations are applied
npm run db:migrate
```

#### Tests Failing

```bash
# Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose

# Check if test database is configured
cat .env | grep DATABASE_URL

# Clear Jest cache
npx jest --clearCache
```

#### Docker Build Fails

```bash
# Check Docker daemon
docker info

# Clear Docker cache
docker builder prune

# Rebuild without cache
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

#### CI/CD Workflows Failing

```bash
# Check workflow syntax
cat .github/workflows/lint-and-format.yml | grep -E "^\s*-"

# Verify secrets are set
# Go to: GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions

# Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
```

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

Run these commands in sequence to verify everything works:

```bash
# 1. Code Quality
npm run lint && npm run format:check

# 2. Tests
npm test

# 3. Local Server
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5000/health in browser

# 4. Docker Development
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
# Open http://localhost:5000/health in browser

# 5. Docker Production Build
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build

# 6. Push to GitHub (triggers CI/CD)
git add .
git commit -m "chore: final verification"
git push origin main
```

### Success Criteria

- [ ] All commands complete without errors
- [ ] API responds correctly
- [ ] Docker containers run successfully
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows pass
- [ ] Status badges show green
